# Website

This is my website being rebuilt in NodeJS. Previously, it was written in Python using the Flask framework.
After gaining much more expirience in general web development, I have come to love programming with NodeJS.
As of right now, I am using the Express framework and PUG as my page renderer for the frontend, while using
MySQL to store data. 

Future plans:

**High Priority:**
* Create more modern and appealing brand logo and design.
* Rebuild the frontend with React and Ant Design. Trying something new...
* Re-work the backend for better secuity practices.

**Low Priority**
* SMS 2FA with AWS
* Maybe integrate SSO with LDAP or Active Directory for admin login???
